# Impact_Of_Tailwind_On_Landings
This project permits to determine the impact of the tailwind on landings. The goal was to check if the probability of having a long
landing increases with tailwind or not.
This project is based on the information from one year of flights (Avianca database) : the long landing flights are known and it is possible to get the information of the weather (direction of the wind and intensity) for each flight thanks to another databse (ICAO one).

The projetc is separated into different sections. Each folder has got an Explanations file.

/!\ the ava2018.json file is not complete because the orignal file was too big. It contains only the flights for January 2018.
/!\ don't forget to change the path name of the file in the python code.
