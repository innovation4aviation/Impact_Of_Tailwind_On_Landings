# Impact_Of_Tailwind_On_Landings
This project permits to determine the impact of the tailwind on landings. The goal was to check if the probability of having a long
landing increases with tailwind or not.
This project is based on the information from one year of flights (Avianca database) : the long landing flights are known and it is possible to get the information of the weather (direction of the wind and intensity) for each flight thanks to another databse (ICAO one).

The projetc is separated into different sections. Each folder has got an Explanations file.

/!\ don't forget to change the path name of the file in the python code.

The presentation of the project (pdf file) can explain you the main goal of this project (long landing part).
